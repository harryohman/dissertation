# dissertation

This is the code for my Dissertation titled "Protecitve Associations in the State of Nature". Unfortunately, some of the variable-names are different from what you would
expect reading the dissertation. Thus I have complied a little dictionary to ease the understanding of the code: 

In the dissertation               In the code
Association             -         Coalitions
Agents                  -         Individuals
